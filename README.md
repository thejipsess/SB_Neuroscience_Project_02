This code has the capability to mimic Cochlear implant (CI) sound perception using a noise vocoder.

The main script calls all functions with which it transforms audio to CI audio and runs it through a model of the auditory cortex by Zulfiqar et al. (2020), producing cochleagrams which are then used for machine leraning classification taks to quantify intelligibility of the converted audio signal.

Additional description of the code and its capabilities is avaialable upon request.
